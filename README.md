# spotify-hit-prediction

The project introduces a study on predicting the success of tracks on Spotify. The goal is to build a predictive model that can forecast the potential success of a song on the platform. • The project will look at how different areas are affected. It will check how the music world is changing and see how ads and marketing are doing. The study will also see changes in movies, TV, and other media, and how social media stars are influencing things. It will also look at the changes in music streaming sites and understand what customers like and think. • The project's dataset has 41,106 entries and 18 different types of information. It includes details about songs like their beats per minute, energy levels, how danceable they are, their loudness, live performance feel, mood, duration, acoustic nature, spoken parts, and popularity ranking.

# Modelling Approaches:
•Logistic Regression • KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) • Decision Trees

The end result of the project will be the deployment of a machine learning model that predicts whether a song is a "Hit" or a "Flop".
